<div id="explain">
	 <h1 class="end" style="font-size:15px">Were you conscious of the reasons why your where clicking on this website? <br> Did you realize what your CLICS could mean? Let me do a review: </h1> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> CURIOSITY</h1>
	 <h2 class="end"> When you clic on the arrow on the "enter" page, you were kind of curious to know what could be the next page about. </h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> CONSTRAINT</h1>
	 <h2 class="end"> On the second page, you were forced to choose a language. You clicked on the one you the most at ease with ; as you might do often on different websites. It was a constraint since you had to choose in order to understand what is then said. </h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> CHOICE</h1>
	 <h2 class="end"> Then, you had the choice of selecting a word or a domain which you paid more attention to. Your clic gave you the chance to feel a sort of freedom and responsibility. </h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> ACCÃˆS</h1>
	 <h2 class="end"> You clicked on "start" and this gave you acces to something. Your clic can be a way of openning a door on any kind of information. </h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> POWER</h1>
	 <h2 class="end"> When you found the letter "N" within "M"s, you felt powerfull. Your clic in this situation was the symbol of empowerment and strength.</h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> SPEECH </h1>
	 <h2 class="end">By writing a sentence, typing and then clicking gave you a freedom of speech. You were able to express yourself. A clic is also a medium which give users the chance of saying what they think, communicate, analyse. It is the symbol of any kind of expression for the public and people's status or origin doesn't matter.</h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> SUBMISSION </h1>
	 <h2 class="end">On the page when you where asked to choose an image, your clic showed that you accepted ot were unconscious of being under control. You choose an image that might not have brought some interest but you clicked because you were asked to.</h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> TARGET </h1>
	 <h2 class="end"> After you selected one image, it appeared on a part of the next page and you had to find a way out of all those pictures. Your previous clicking selection made you a target. A clic can be a way for advertising to transform you as a target : the goal is you influence your actions, and it can be oppressive. A clic can be a medium to know your taste better and then control your choices on the web. You had to find a way to get rid of all those pics ! And this happens a lot with adverstising.</h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> PROTECTION </h1>
	 <h2 class="end"> When you clicked "QUIT" on the warning box, your clic protected you from a fear of being pirated or infected.</h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> FRUSTRATION </h1>
	 <h2 class="end"> You thought during your visit on this website that you had steps left before it was the end of your clicking visit. But you felt frustrated when you saw that it was finished, right? At least a little bit :  all you clic made you feel a kind of advancement, progression... but sometimes clicking is not bringing anything to you, or not what you expected.</h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="color: blue"> KNOWLEDGE </h1>
	 <h2 class="end"> And finally... at the end you clic on "NEXT" brought you on this page. And by clicking, you were able to read this text, and to have a little bit more knowledge and consciouness about the CLIC... I hope :) </h2> <br>
	 <h1 class="end" style="font-size:15px" > A clic is an action and must be taken in consideration like all other sort of human actions. You must take advantage of it and be aware of its risks, limits and restrictions.  </h1>
